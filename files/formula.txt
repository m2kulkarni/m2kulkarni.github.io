In the PC game Civilization, Gandhi was known for often being the first one to use nuclear weapons, which seems contrary to his expected passive nature. Players had a theory that Gandhi’s aggression setting was initially set at 1, but if he chose a democratic government, he’d get a -2 aggression modifier (lowering his current aggression value by 2). This would cause his aggression to overflow to 255, making him maximally aggressive! However, more recently Sid Meier (the game’s author) clarified that this wasn’t actually the case.

Inspiration is perishable and life goes by fast. Inaction is a particularly insidious type of risk.
